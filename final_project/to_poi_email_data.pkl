on   am richard lydeckerenron   pm to brian redmondhouectect cc subject hanov gkh merger idea the follow is a quick review of the gkh merger analysi and the reason we do not support it it is also import to keep in mind that gkh is motiv to creat a shortterm exit from hanov due to the exig of their invest partnership expir klein agenda is transpar  while hanov is a wellmanag growth compani it is not a turnaround or special opportun situat for which applic of enron busi model would promis the extraordinari return requir in order to justifi an invest of  billion  as enron stock price has declin the attract of use it as a currenc in ani acquisit has decreas the pe declin also tend to make stock deal more dilut to enron  the gkh analysi assert  million in initi year synergi and cost

revenu and margin and signific sg a reductions million the remain  million of cite benefit relat to a propos decapit of hanov from a propos transfer of asset to a nonrecours trust although credit enhanc and oper guarante would be requir achiev these benefit would requir obtain the best possibl outcom on a number of account financi and credit issu howev even if all of these issu were resolv the econom result is insuffici to justifi the transact the gkh analysi doe not consid transact transit or capit cost  after take into account the capit expenditur requir for hanov to achiev it aggress growth target the compani appear to be at best cash flow neutral or slight cash flow negat for the three year present in the gkh analysi even includ all claim synergi and cost save  enron and hanov could achiev and share mani of the synergist benefit claim for the merger in a proper structur joint ventur howev this would still requir find an intern enron sponsor to assum ownership of the relationship  much of hanov growth in the futur is predic upon an aggress expans and expenditur program intern given enron domest opportun this intern orient in a noncor busi is inconsist with our present strategi  like gkh enron has been a seller of our hanov posit an abrupt revers of strategi could creat signific uncertainti and confus on the street about enron strateg direct addit background to demonstr the magnitud of the limit of the gkh analysi with respect to increas enron ep  if pool of interest account is avail ani acquisit enron make of ani compani that has a lower pe ratio than enron is accret to enron ep there is noth remark about this it is simpl mathemat  if purchas account is requir even if the entir purchas price were account as goodwil and never amort this would onli replic the result of pool of interest howev in actual a signific proport of the purchas price would have to be alloc to asset tangibl and intang such as contract which would produc addit depreci and amort expens not mention in the gkh analysi  the largest singl synergi by far in the gkh analysi is usag of enron nol to shield hanov taxabl earn enron can obtain the benefit of it nol by acquir ani profit compani gm record about  billion in incom tax expens last year which would offer even greater opportun to utilit this enron asset  the gkh analysi is total silent with respect to the biggest

c amp the vender that make the  pair connector are no longer manufactur the connector need for the  pair cabl the vender will be make a special run to make more of them for enron in late decemb hope they will make enough to last until june of   this group also util the stentofon and amtel system a again this floor is not wire to support these devic  the respons time would be affect a the trade floor support team is locat on level  near the ena trade floor a team of onli three support all enron ipc phone record channel stentofon and amtel on the trade floor team member would have to use two elev bank instead of the stair for one or two floor befor they could be on site for this group b we now have three other trade floor that we support that are not on level   or  and one more would hurt

provid for escrow the proceed doe not provid for separ do insur and doe not address the deal compens klaynsf ken i thought it would be better if i type my thought for you sinc my hand write can be somewhat difficult to read befor you decid the methodolog for move our project beyond the d ambani phone call i would like to share a few thought that i believ reduc the risk of enron be an ep buyer i know the implic of make a larg ep purchas are far greater than just the cash requir but i believ with the follow chang to the plan present yesterday and a littl rd parti inform you may feel more comfort make this decis under the buysel arrang a small risk of buy will alway be present but i believ the risk reward ratio in this case has veri strong merit my goal for enron are three fold a sale the asset b get cash in the door befor yearend and c get fair valu for the asset given the current situat my comment touch upon five topic  revers the buysel process give enron the control vote  pay the penalti  contact someon at the janus fund to talk about relianc financi condit  thought on nonreli bidder  inform and the futur process revers the buysel process the plan outlin yesterday use the buysel scenario is the best scenario for achiev all of our goal the risk for enron which is most troubl is the possibl of be a buyer versus a desir to be a seller i firm believ if we make one chang to the plan as describ below we can increas our probabl of a success sale to near  if we dont use a butsel arrang i am concern that we will not get fair valu or cash in the door this year in fact i suspect we will elect not to sell becaus of contract or valuat problem which in effect leav us with a strand asset and a lot of employe problem when you talk with dhirubhai we can propos the buysel concept with ril make the first bid to purchas enron then has the right to sell at that price or increas the bid by  and ril must sell sinc we are now in the control posit the  tax logic we talk about yesterday no longer is valid so i would describ the  as a control premium the onli reason we want the buy option is in the event they offer a veri low number i would suspect them to bid in the  to  million rang they just turn down my offer to purchas their asset at mm and indic we were substanti below their valu when i tri to engag them in a dialogu they know enron paid  million just  month ago for the same posit we know they intern have reserv book higher than our and have a strong desir to have a substanti upstream posit that they can control it is possibl that ril would bid less than  million but i put that probabl at less than one percent this reduc enron risk dramat and increas our probabl of get all of our object met we also get an ad benefit from pitch the deal with ril as the first bidder becaus this will strengthen the percept that we enron want to be the buyer which is a key percept to have a fair auction with onli one legitim buyer relianc if we pitch the deal as suggest abov we need to recognis go in that they probabl want the control posit as well i believ they would pay a veri larg valu for these asset due to their tax posit and by bid first they take great risk of leav a lot of money on the tabl or not get the deal at all i would suspect that they will at a minimum suggest we flip a coin to see who bid first initi i would just say no but we may need to deal with this issu and probabl should decid earli on if it is a deal killer if we did flip a coin we would wait until the document were final and the escrow agreement was sign so there would be no back out without a penalti in this scenario it would actual help get a more imparti document done quicker if neither parti knew the bid sequenc until after the draft was final pay the penalti while it is not the way we want to do busi the worst case scenario under the propos escrow agreement is to forfeit  million if we elect not to follow through in an enron buy scenario consid the upsid to the buysel under either sequenc enron first or ril first it may be worth the risk of lose the escrow under a black friday scenario i want to think about this over the weekend but while i was think this afternoon the risk reward seem to be veri favor contact someon at janus fund this was suggest yesterday and i would strong urg you to do this if you feel comfort make the inquiri janus bought approxim a  posit in ril about  month ago i think you will get a veri posit report on both the cash front and their desir to make the upstream a key part of the compani thought on non relianc bidder i have spent a lot more time think about this issu i can talk you through the reason but as long as relianc is involv and a western compani can onli purchas a  nonoper work interest we will have to take a huge discount to fair valu i will be veri surpris if we could get  million again go to the shell bgsetc earli on in the process i believ is a huge mistak both intern and extern inform flow and process ken this is a veri sensit area but i feel compel to mention this to you i am concern about too mani peopl know our plan and strategi and possibl other want to branch out with the intent of help but actual caus problem this need to be manag by one person not three or four to meet all of our object this has to be an orchestr deal from a to z i think you know more about my background then most other in enron i work the ep ma busi for  year and did pretti well at it i know the oil busi and i believ that is a key to get a good deal done i know these asset and all of the complex issu surround the asset our subsidiari tax issu and the book consider im the best person to get this deal done onc you decid the risk the compani is will to take i know the limit of my author and i will work within those bound and keep the ooc complet and total inform so proper decis can be made when necessari ken i promis you i will use other in the compani where and when appropri if i need help in india i would not hesit to ask sanjay for such howev the last thing we can afford is excess discuss in india on this deal if dhirubhai agre to the deal we need to get a meet set in europ at a neutral site to start the process my main object is to have a success deal i have decid not to go to india so we can concentr on move this forward also i will need your guidanc on the futur of the ep plan for enron when we decid the direct we plan to take on panna mukta and tapti i have look at the key peopl necessari to make this happen and can talk to you about that as well if you so desir thank jeff klaynsf ken i thought it would be better if i type my thought for you sinc my hand write can be somewhat difficult to read befor you decid the methodolog for move our project beyond the d ambani phone call i would like to share a few thought that i believ reduc the risk of enron be an ep buyer i know the implic of make a larg ep purchas are far greater than just the cash requir but i believ with the follow chang to the plan present yesterday and a littl rd parti inform you may feel more comfort make this decis under the buysel arrang a small risk of buy will alway be present but i believ the risk reward ratio in this case has veri strong merit my goal for enron are three fold a sale the asset b get cash in the door befor yearend and c get fair valu for the asset given the current situat my comment touch upon five topic  revers the buysel process give enron the control vote  pay the penalti  contact someon at the janus fund to talk about relianc financi condit  thought on nonreli bidder  inform and the futur process revers the buysel process the plan outlin yesterday use the buysel scenario is the best scenario for achiev all of our goal the risk for enron which is most troubl is the possibl of be a buyer versus a desir to be a seller i firm believ if we make one chang to the plan as describ below we can increas our probabl of a success sale to near  if we dont use a butsel arrang i am concern that we will not get fair valu or cash in the door this year in fact i suspect we will elect not to sell becaus of contract or valuat problem which in effect leav us with a strand asset and a lot of employe problem when you talk with dhirubhai we can propos the buysel concept with ril make the first bid to purchas enron then has the right to sell at that price or increas the bid by  and ril must sell sinc we are now in the control posit the  tax logic we talk about yesterday no longer is valid so i would describ the  as a control premium the onli reason we want the buy option is in the event they offer a veri low number i would suspect them to bid in the  to  million rang they just turn down my offer to purchas their asset at mm and indic we were substanti below their valu when i tri to engag them in a dialogu they know enron paid  million just  month ago for the same posit we know they intern have reserv book higher than our and have a strong desir to have a substanti upstream posit that they can control it is possibl that ril would bid less than  million but i put that probabl at less than one percent this reduc enron risk dramat and increas our probabl of get all of our object met we also get an ad benefit from pitch the deal with ril as the first bidder becaus this will strengthen the percept that we enron want to be the buyer which is a key percept to have a fair auction with onli one legitim buyer relianc if we pitch the deal as suggest abov we need to recognis go in that they probabl want the control posit as well i believ they would pay a veri larg valu for these asset due to their tax posit and by bid first they take great risk of leav a lot of money on the tabl or not get the deal at all i would suspect that they will at a minimum suggest we flip a coin to see who bid first initi i would just say no but we may need to deal with this issu and probabl should decid earli on if it is a deal killer if we did flip a coin we would wait until the document were final and the escrow agreement was sign so there would be no back out without a penalti in this scenario it would actual help get a more imparti document done quicker if neither parti knew the bid sequenc until after the draft was final pay the penalti while it is not the way we want to do busi the worst case scenario under the propos escrow agreement is to forfeit  million if we elect not to follow through in an enron buy scenario consid the upsid to the buysel under either sequenc enron first or ril first it may be worth the risk of lose the escrow under a black friday scenario i want to think about this over the weekend but while i was think this afternoon the risk reward seem to be veri favor contact someon at janus fund this was suggest yesterday and i would strong urg you to do this if you feel comfort make the inquiri janus bought approxim a  posit in ril about  month ago i think you will get a veri posit report on both the cash front and their desir to make the upstream a key part of the compani thought on non relianc bidder i have spent a lot more time think about this issu i can talk you through the reason but as long as relianc is involv and a western compani can onli purchas a  nonoper work interest we will have to take a huge discount to fair valu i will be veri surpris if we could get  million again go to the shell bgsetc earli on in the process i believ is a huge mistak both intern and extern inform flow and process ken this is a veri sensit area but i feel compel to mention this to you i am concern about too mani peopl know our plan and strategi and possibl other want to branch out with the intent of help but actual caus problem this need to be manag by one person not three or four to meet all of our object this has to be an orchestr deal from a to z i think you know more about my background then most other in enron i work the ep ma busi for  year and did pretti well at it i know the oil busi and i believ that is a key to get a good deal done i know these asset and all of the complex issu surround the asset our subsidiari tax issu and the book consider im the best person to get this deal done onc you decid the risk the compani is will to take i know the limit of my author and i will work within those bound and keep the ooc complet and total inform so proper decis can be made when necessari ken i promis you i will use other in the compani where and when appropri if i need help in india i would not hesit to ask sanjay for such howev the last thing we can afford is excess discuss in india on this deal if dhirubhai agre to the deal we need to get a meet set in europ at a neutral site to start the process my main object is to have a success deal i have decid not to go to india so we can concentr on move this forward also i will need your guidanc on the futur of the ep plan for enron when we decid the direct we plan to take on panna mukta and tapti i have look at the key peopl necessari to make this happen and can talk to you about that as well if you so desir thank jeff klay nonprivilegedpst ken thank for your messag communic even if it is brief from yo u is absolut critic at this time while enron has a veri tough road a head i think i can speak for sever peopl on my team that we are support ive of the nondynegi rout regardless of the option we ultim plan to pursu i know the best thing i can do for enron is to sell our remain asset to either bg or anoth counter parti i am commit to this task and we will continu to focus on bg but we need to be prepar that it may be necessari to take a differ path to sell the india ep asset in a strang way the termin of the dynegi merger may actual help the ep sale becaus it take away the automat loss of operatorship ongc was usi ng as leverag depend on enron corp plan we may have a much stron ger messag to play with our indian partner and the goi they should be c oncern that we will keep ownership and operatorship long term and they s hould also be concern that we will not want to spend the capit to expan d the project someth the goiongc realli want to do after you anno unc corp plan i will go to india and meet with our partner and the goi in this regard  base on your note below and earlier comment i know the trade busi is a key compon to your futur core oper i am support of that decis becaus i saw the enorm valu it can generat in the right cir cumstanc as i have mention befor i think the compani should sell bu siness such as the ep compani that are noncor it is the right thing to do especi in these circumst howev some of the noncor bu siness generat good cashflow like the ep compani and we have to be ca reful in this environ to make sure the compani support the valuabl noncor busi until they can be monet  i also know most of your senior advisor are discipl of the trade busi ness becaus they grew up in that environ they are veri comfort and knowledg of this busi model and there will be tremend press ure to maintain certain trade activ or peopl for the futur even wh en the nearterm valu is question i hope somebodi at the tabl ask the question if we focus our limit financi resourc to maintain this futur benefit have we lost a valuabl nearterm noncor resourc i k now these decis are not easi or clearcut but in this new paradigm th is could happen pretti easili sinc most of the player at the tabl do not understand enron noncor busi or what it take to optim neart erm valu this comment is not intend to offend anybodi but it is a conc ern for exampl enron made financi commit of  million to our staf f to maintain oper and sell our asset weve sold everyth except eogil and we have negoti mutual accept psas with two differ compani for eogil but due to some extraordinari circumst this has proven to be a tough sale as i mention in the first paragraph i think we can get there but it may take a littl more time and we need to mainta in staff dure the interim i recogn everyth has chang due to recent event i am not ask f or a handout becaus that is the way it was befor or anyth like that my point is the compani will have to make tough decis regard which i ndividu to incentiv and i believ the exist commit to the ep team should be maintain even though this is a noncor busi reaffi rming the compani commit to the  million will give us a good pro babil of keep enough of the core staff to achiev our goal and monet ize the asset soon i recogn that  million is not a trivial sum of money but without these individu we stand to lose  to  million in the next  month therefor i have believ this is the right decis for enron i believ egep is one of the valuabl noncor busi but if this be come a point of controversi i would at least like the opportun to prese nt my case in person to one of you thank for take the time to read my note jeff origin messag from ken lay offic of the chairman  sentwednesday novemb    pm todlgaallenronworldwide subjectupd as you have heard dynegi is termin the merger agreement today among other thing this mean we are now free to pursu other altern wh ich we are activ do as a consequ of uncertainti about the deal and now dynegi announc enron debt was downgrad to below inv stment grade level today by sp moodi and fitch  in respons to this action we have initi a plan to protect valu in ou r core trade and other energi busi at the same time we are neari ng the complet of the busi review process announc last week onc this process is complet we will be conduct a comprehens restructur ing of our busi regrett but unavoid this will includ the s ale of noncor asset and the implement of a comprehens cost savin g plan includ layoffs we are take these action to focus our resourc on preserv the valu of our core busi retain our employe who are key to our futur s uccess and maintain relationship with our trade counterparti thi s must be our prioriti to establish a more solid foot for the rest of en ron i know you have serious concern about what this all mean for you althou gh there are no guarante you should know that we are still in this figh t and remain absolut commit to protect the valu of the ongo bu siness of enron all i can ask is that we all be support of each oth r stay focus on our work as best we can and stick togeth while we wor k to overcom these latest challeng even six or so week ago none of us could have imagin that we would be w here we are today we will not recov in six week what we have lost but we will work to stabil and then rebuild this great compani as alway i appreci the extraordinari contribut each of you make thank

yesterday that it initi public offer ipo of  million common share was price at  per share the stock close yesterday at  per share the compani expect to receiv net proceed from the offer of it share at approxim  million exclus of the underwrit option to purchas an addit al  common share to cover over allot tnpc inca partnersh ip between enron america onlin aol and ibmwa form in late  to provid electr and natur gas direct to household and small busi in the deregul energi marketplac tnpcs share will be list on the nyse under the symbol npw close of the offer is expect to occur oct  analysi i am sure that mani eyebrow were rais when tnpc issu the ipo of it stock at  a figur that seem surpris high for a start up compani that has been in oper onli sinc earli summer it is rather mindboggl that a compani with no signific track record could open it stock at such a price but it is not unheard of in fact tnpc is follow a trend of new internet compani initi ipo that are support by grand concept rather than tangibl success howev the tnpc dream team allianc between enron aol and ibm has been met with great expect and a lot of skeptic as well throughout the industri i read through the sa file that tnpc submit to the sec so hopeful y i can cut through the hype regard this deal to get to it nucleus first tnpc acknowledg repeat throughout it file that it is enter into an extrem highrisk ventur and in fact will incur substanti oper and net loss and cannot assur that we will attain profit further tnpc admit that it expect to incur these loss for a signific but undetermin period of time whi then would wall street be greet this ipo with such a posit welcom one could easili argu that the sheer market presenc of enron aol and ibm has by associ driven up the valu of tnpc but i think a deeper answer lie within sever factor first tnpc has been bankrol by some hefti invest in two separ privat placement investor such as enron ge capit equiti invest and dljmb partner among other put up about  million in startup capit in exchang for share in the compani enron is the major owner of tnpc with percent control this money has allow tnpc to make import acquisit for instanc tnpc bought the residenti and small commercia l retail energi busi of columbia energi group which includ approxim ly  naturalga custom and  electr custom in eight state this is a valuabl card in tnpcs deck as it lock in custom dure this time when deregul is develop slowli in retail market i wouldnt be surpris if tnpc make a similar acquisit of anoth custom base in the near futur such as in texa where custom have been spun off to energi servic compani rather than be held by the td oper of util in other word in texa tnpc could easili buy custom without have to buy wire or infrastructur assum there is a will seller second and perhap more import earlier this year enron transfer it residenti and small commerci retail oper in california and ohio to tnpc this deal includ the oper of enron energi servic but did not includ pge energi servic which enron acquir earlier this year togeth with the columbia energi group acquisit tnpc has come out of the gate run with a signific begin custom base of over  custom whi would enron have turn over it residenti custom to tnpc dont forget that enron struggl in and retreat from the california residenti market state that it couldnt make ani money in the retail market tnpcs sa file confirm rumor that enron energi servic actual retreat from california due to a lawsuit claimin g the compani had violat law relat to advertis direct to residenti al consum in  and  enron was in fact ban from sell power to the residenti market in california under this custom transfer enron is abl to put it money into a complet separ businessessen tialli move this highrisk busi ventur and worst perform part of it retail servic off it own book yet if tnpc succeed enron still benefi ts as it is the major owner i think these two factor answer whi wall street has look so favor on a selfdescrib new compani with a limit oper histori look ahead can tnpc maintain this compar high valu of it stock well there both good news and bad news for tnpc first let look on the bright side tnpc has put into place a great manag team start with h eugen lockhart former of att as presid and ceo other key player bring retail market expertis from work at mastercard exxon and pespico in addit within the energi industri tnpc arguabl could not have a better backer than enron what other compani touch has been golden in near everi ventur it has pursu in addit to be the major owner enron probabl is also provid tnpc access to commod at preferenti price which will certain enhanc it sale approach in the retail market plus tnpc has access to the  million custom that aol repres which ive alway thought was the compani secret weapon but then there are the risk and they are substanti first competit is not materi rapid on the retail side in a state like pennsylvan ia which perhap repres the strongest deregul market in the unit state onli about  percent of custom in peco territori have opt to switch their provid so tnpc has an uphil climb to say the least in make ani inroad at captur a lockand make moneyin the ret ail market second the onli way that i can see tnpc make it at all is if they continu to buy custom like they did from columbia energi group there are big question surround whether the compani will be abl to do this or not and much of it success hing on this uncertainti third and perhap most serious of all is tnpcs vulner on the technolog side of it oper tnpc has enter into a year revenu manag and custom care agreement with ibm global servic under which ibm will manag the compani onlin commerc and bill applic s ibm track record in develop custom care system is less than stellar in fact pge initi a lawsuit against ibm a few year ago when the util had to pull the plug on a massiv  million custom inform system cis employ by ibm which it claim was ineffect ibm has partner with sct to provid the infrastructur to be use by tnpc under an agreement between ibm global servic and sct the sct banner cis will be integr into a number of backoffic it solut under develop by ibm for tnpc expert in the cis industri have question whether scts banner cis can handl over one million custom if it cannot this will sure limit tnpcs growth potenti moreov although tnpcs ipo signal a strong futur there are many uncertainti surround this nascent oper as one of the few major player in the energi retail market tnpc has veri few competitor with the possibl except of newenergi or greenmountain anoth competitor is also emergi ng in britain centrica which plan to expand in north america after it recent acquisit of canadian retail gas supplier direct energy

million in startup capit in exchang for share in the compani enron is the major owner of tnpc with percent control this money has allow tnpc to make import acquisit for instanc tnpc bought the residenti and small commercia l retail energi busi of columbia energi group which includ approxim ly  naturalga custom and  electr custom in eight state this is a valuabl card in tnpcs deck as it lock in custom dure this time when deregul is develop slowli in retail market i wouldnt be surpris if tnpc make a similar acquisit of anoth custom base in the near futur such as in texa where custom have been spun off to energi servic compani rather than be held by the td oper of util in other word in texa tnpc could easili buy custom without have to buy wire or infrastructur assum there is a will seller second and perhap more import earlier this year enron transfer it residenti and small commerci retail oper in california and ohio to tnpc this deal includ the oper of enron energi servic but did not includ pge energi servic which enron acquir earlier this year togeth with the columbia energi group acquisit tnpc has come out of the gate run with a signific begin custom base of over  custom whi would enron have turn over it residenti custom to tnpc dont forget that enron struggl in and retreat from the california residenti market state that it couldnt make ani money in the retail market tnpcs sa file confirm rumor that enron energi servic actual retreat from california due to a lawsuit claimin g the compani had violat law relat to advertis direct to residenti al consum in  and  enron was in fact ban from sell power to the residenti market in california under this custom transfer enron is abl to put it money into a complet separ businessessen tialli move this highrisk busi ventur and worst perform part of it retail servic off it own book yet if tnpc succeed enron still benefi ts as it is the major owner i think these two factor answer whi wall street has look so favor on a selfdescrib new compani with a limit oper histori look ahead can tnpc maintain this compar high valu of it stock well there both good news and bad news for tnpc first let look on the bright side tnpc has put into place a great manag team start with h eugen lockhart former of att as presid and ceo other key player bring retail market expertis from work at mastercard exxon and pespico in addit within the energi industri tnpc arguabl could not have a better backer than enron what other compani touch has been golden in near everi ventur it has pursu in addit to be the major owner enron probabl is also provid tnpc access to commod at preferenti price which will certain enhanc it sale approach in the retail market plus tnpc has access to the  million custom that aol repres which ive alway thought was the compani secret weapon but then there are the risk and they are substanti first competit is not materi rapid on the retail side in a state like pennsylvan ia which perhap repres the strongest deregul market in the unit state onli about  percent of custom in peco territori have opt to switch their provid so tnpc has an uphil climb to say the least in make ani inroad at captur a lockand make moneyin the ret ail market second the onli way that i can see tnpc make it at all is if they continu to buy custom like they did from columbia energi group there are big question surround whether the compani will be abl to do this or not and much of it success hing on this uncertainti third and perhap most serious of all is tnpcs vulner on the technolog side of it oper tnpc has enter into a year revenu manag and custom care agreement with ibm global servic under which ibm will manag the compani onlin commerc and bill applic s ibm track record in develop custom care system is less than stellar in fact pge initi a lawsuit against ibm a few year ago when the util had to pull the plug on a massiv  million custom inform system cis employ by ibm which it claim was ineffect ibm has partner with sct to provid the infrastructur to be use by tnpc under an agreement between ibm global servic and sct the sct banner cis will be integr into a number of backoffic it solut under develop by ibm for tnpc expert in the cis industri have question whether scts banner cis can handl over one million custom if it cannot this will sure limit tnpcs growth potenti moreov although tnpcs ipo signal a strong futur there are many uncertainti surround this nascent oper as one of the few major player in the energi retail market tnpc has veri few competitor with the possibl except of newenergi or greenmountain anoth competitor is also emergi ng in britain centrica which plan to expand in north america after it recent acquisit of canadian retail gas supplier direct energy

caramani and i creat this present build on previous present by tim belden and dave parquet in the present and the meet we made the follow point there isnt much ferc can do becaus the caus of the price spike is not in the wholesal market we discourag ferc from take ani action that would hurt the vibrant wholesal market in the california and the rest of the west as well high price logic result from scarciti and if the commiss doe anyth it should  investig whether market power was be exercis by ani parti and  if necessari to protect the market while still incent need generat establish a price cap at a scarciti rent level equal to the price at which load were will to interrupt the ious have not proper prepar for the risk of high price caus by scarciti they have fail to hedg and have underschedul their load therefor have to fill a larg percentag of their load at iso real time price my analog was that this was like day trade your retir fund as an asset alloc scheme the market would function better if more inform was provid to the market the commiss should do whatev it can to incent particip by load to see the present detach save and view in powerpoint when you do you will find

marketplac tnpcs share will be list on the nyse under the symbol npw close of the offer is expect to occur oct  analysi i am sure that mani eyebrow were rais when tnpc issu the ipo of it stock at  a figur that seem surpris high for a start up compani that has been in oper onli sinc earli summer it is rather mindboggl that a compani with no signific track record could open it stock at such a price but it is not unheard of in fact tnpc is follow a trend of new internet compani initi ipo that are support by grand concept rather than tangibl success howev the tnpc dream team allianc between enron aol and ibm has been met with great expect and a lot of skeptic as well throughout the industri i read through the sa file that tnpc submit to the sec so hopeful y i can cut through the hype regard this deal to get to it nucleus first tnpc acknowledg repeat throughout it file that it is enter into an extrem highrisk ventur and in fact will incur substanti oper and net loss and cannot assur that we will attain profit further tnpc admit that it expect to incur these loss for a signific but undetermin period of time whi then would wall street be greet this ipo with such a posit welcom one could easili argu that the sheer market presenc of enron aol and ibm has by associ driven up the valu of tnpc but i think a deeper answer lie within sever factor first tnpc has been bankrol by some hefti invest in two separ privat placement investor such as enron ge capit equiti invest and dljmb partner among other put up about  million in startup capit in exchang for share in the compani enron is the major owner of tnpc with percent control this money has allow tnpc to make import acquisit for instanc tnpc bought the residenti and small commercia l retail energi busi of columbia energi group which includ approxim ly  naturalga custom and  electr custom in eight state this is a valuabl card in tnpcs deck as it lock in custom dure this time when deregul is develop slowli in retail market i wouldnt be surpris if tnpc make a similar acquisit of anoth custom base in the near futur such as in texa where custom have been spun off to energi servic compani rather than be held by the td oper of util in other word in texa tnpc could easili buy custom without have to buy wire or infrastructur assum there is a will seller second and perhap more import earlier this year enron transfer it residenti and small commerci retail oper in california and ohio to tnpc this deal includ the oper of enron energi servic but did not includ pge energi servic which enron acquir earlier this year togeth with the columbia energi group acquisit tnpc has come out of the gate run with a signific begin custom base of over  custom whi would enron have turn over it residenti custom to tnpc dont forget that enron struggl in and retreat from the california residenti market state that it couldnt make ani money in the retail market tnpcs sa file confirm rumor that enron energi servic actual retreat from california due to a lawsuit claimin g the compani had violat law relat to advertis direct to residenti al consum in  and  enron was in fact ban from sell power to the residenti market in california under this custom transfer enron is abl to put it money into a complet separ businessessen tialli move this highrisk busi ventur and worst perform part of it retail servic off it own book yet if tnpc succeed enron still benefi ts as it is the major owner i think these two factor answer whi wall street has look so favor on a selfdescrib new compani with a limit oper histori look ahead can tnpc maintain this compar high valu of it stock well there both good news and bad news for tnpc first let look on the bright side tnpc has put into place a great manag team start with h eugen lockhart former of att as presid and ceo other key player bring retail market expertis from work at mastercard exxon and pespico in addit within the energi industri tnpc arguabl could not have a better backer than enron what other compani touch has been golden in near everi ventur it has pursu in addit to be the major owner enron probabl is also provid tnpc access to commod at preferenti price which will certain enhanc it sale approach in the retail market plus tnpc has access to the  million custom that aol repres which ive alway thought was the compani secret weapon but then there are the risk and they are substanti first competit is not materi rapid on the retail side in a state like pennsylvan ia which perhap repres the strongest deregul market in the unit state onli about  percent of custom in peco territori have opt to switch their provid so tnpc has an uphil climb to say the least in make ani inroad at captur a lockand make moneyin the ret ail market second the onli way that i can see tnpc make it at all is if they continu to buy custom like they did from columbia energi group there are big question surround whether the compani will be abl to do this or not and much of it success hing on this uncertainti third and perhap most serious of all is tnpcs vulner on the technolog side of it oper tnpc has enter into a year revenu manag and custom care agreement with ibm global servic under which ibm will manag the compani onlin commerc and bill applic s ibm track record in develop custom care system is less than stellar in fact pge initi a lawsuit against ibm a few year ago when the util had to pull the plug on a massiv  million custom inform system cis employ by ibm which it claim was ineffect ibm has partner with sct to provid the infrastructur to be use by tnpc under an agreement between ibm global servic and sct the sct banner cis will be integr into a number of backoffic it solut under develop by ibm for tnpc expert in the cis industri have question whether scts banner cis can handl over one million custom if it cannot this will sure limit tnpcs growth potenti moreov although tnpcs ipo signal a strong futur there are many uncertainti surround this nascent oper as one of the few major player in the energi retail market tnpc has veri few competitor with the possibl except of newenergi or greenmountain anoth competitor is also emergi ng in britain centrica which plan to expand in north america after it recent acquisit of canadian retail gas supplier direct energy consequ the come year could either make or break tnpc and the

that they wont take a stand on someth which is in the best interest of the vast major of their membership if it will alien a vocal few electr restructur was a key exampl of this there was no doubt where they should have been on the issu but instead of embrac retail open access legisl at the feder level they decid to have a process natur all the util volunt to particip in the process and outnumb the nonutil member when it came time to vote the vote support wholesal but not retail reform with heavi emphasi on ensur strand cost recoveri afterward the feder debat shift sole to wholesal legisl though this is not exclus the chamber fault unfortun tom forc and competit approach when it come to rais his membership roll leav him unwil to do the right thing if a few member will be upset for enron it a bit like pay  for a veto right the onli thing the organ push for are the thing everyon agre on in the busi communiti eg china pntr and lower corpor tax thing they will push for whether we

associ driven up the valu of tnpc but i think a deeper answer lie within sever factor first tnpc has been bankrol by some hefti invest in two separ privat placement investor such as enron ge capit equiti invest and dljmb partner among other put up about  million in startup capit in exchang for share in the compani enron is the major owner of tnpc with percent control this money has allow tnpc to make import acquisit for instanc tnpc bought the residenti and small commercia l retail energi busi of columbia energi group which includ approxim ly  naturalga custom and  electr custom in eight state this is a valuabl card in tnpcs deck as it lock in custom dure this time when deregul is develop slowli in retail market i wouldnt be surpris if tnpc make a similar acquisit of anoth custom base in the near futur such as in texa where custom have been spun off to energi servic compani rather than be held by the td oper of util in other word in texa tnpc could easili buy custom without have to buy wire or infrastructur assum there is a will seller second and perhap more import earlier this year enron transfer it residenti and small commerci retail oper in california and ohio to tnpc this deal includ the oper of enron energi servic but did not includ pge energi servic which enron acquir earlier this year togeth with the columbia energi group acquisit tnpc has come out of the gate run with a signific begin custom base of over  custom whi would enron have turn over it residenti custom to tnpc dont forget that enron struggl in and retreat from the california residenti market state that it couldnt make ani money in the retail market tnpcs sa file confirm rumor that enron energi servic actual retreat from california due to a lawsuit claimin g the compani had violat law relat to advertis direct to residenti al consum in  and  enron was in fact ban from sell power to the residenti market in california under this custom transfer enron is abl to put it money into a complet separ businessessen tialli move this highrisk busi ventur and worst perform part of it retail servic off it own book yet if tnpc succeed enron still benefi ts as it is the major owner i think these two factor answer whi wall street has look so favor on a selfdescrib new compani with a limit oper histori look ahead can tnpc maintain this compar high valu of it stock well there both good news and bad news for tnpc first let look on the bright side tnpc has put into place a great manag team start with h eugen lockhart former of att as presid and ceo other key player bring retail market expertis from work at mastercard exxon and pespico in addit within the energi industri tnpc arguabl could not have a better backer than enron what other compani touch has been golden in near everi ventur it has pursu in addit to be the major owner enron probabl is also provid tnpc access to commod at preferenti price which will certain enhanc it sale approach in the retail market plus tnpc has access to the  million custom that aol repres which ive alway thought was the compani secret weapon but then there are the risk and they are substanti first competit is not materi rapid on the retail side in a state like pennsylvan ia which perhap repres the strongest deregul market in the unit state onli about  percent of custom in peco territori have opt to switch their provid so tnpc has an uphil climb to say the least in make ani inroad at captur a lockand make moneyin the ret ail market second the onli way that i can see tnpc make it at all is if they continu to buy custom like they did from columbia energi group there are big question surround whether the compani will be abl to do this or not and much of it success hing on this uncertainti third and perhap most serious of all is tnpcs vulner on the technolog side of it oper tnpc has enter into a year revenu manag and custom care agreement with ibm global servic under which ibm will manag the compani onlin commerc and bill applic s ibm track record in develop custom care system is less than stellar in fact pge initi a lawsuit against ibm a few year ago when the util had to pull the plug on a massiv  million custom inform system cis employ by ibm which it claim was ineffect ibm has partner with sct to provid the infrastructur to be use by tnpc under an agreement between ibm global servic and sct the sct banner cis will be integr into a number of backoffic it solut under develop by ibm for tnpc expert in the cis industri have question whether scts banner cis can handl over one million custom if it cannot this will sure limit tnpcs growth potenti moreov although tnpcs ipo signal a strong futur there are many uncertainti surround this nascent oper as one of the few major player in the energi retail market tnpc has veri few competitor with the possibl except of newenergi or greenmountain anoth competitor is also emergi ng in britain centrica which plan to expand in north america after it recent acquisit of canadian retail gas supplier direct energy consequ the come year could either make or break tnpc and the challeng that the compani face in want to conquer the retail market are extrem steep

take ani action that would hurt the vibrant wholesal market in the california and the rest of the west as well high price logic result from scarciti and if the commiss doe anyth it should  investig whether market power was be exercis by ani parti and  if necessari to protect the market while still incent need generat establish a price cap at a scarciti rent level equal to the price at which load were will to interrupt the ious have not proper prepar for the risk of high price caus by scarciti they have fail to hedg and have underschedul their load therefor have to fill a larg percentag of

the offer is expect to occur oct  analysi i am sure that mani eyebrow were rais when tnpc issu the ipo of it stock at  a figur that seem surpris high for a start up compani that has been in oper onli sinc earli summer it is rather mindboggl that a compani with no signific track record could open it stock at such a price but it is not unheard of in fact tnpc is follow a trend of new internet compani initi ipo that are support by grand concept rather than tangibl success howev the tnpc dream team allianc between enron aol and ibm has been met with great expect and a lot of skeptic as well throughout the industri i read through the sa file that tnpc submit to the sec so hopeful y i can cut through the hype regard this deal to get to it nucleus first tnpc acknowledg repeat throughout it file that it is enter into an extrem highrisk ventur and in fact will incur substanti oper and net loss and cannot assur that we will attain profit further tnpc admit that it expect to incur these loss for a signific but undetermin period of time whi then would wall street be greet this ipo with such a posit welcom one could easili argu that the sheer market presenc of enron aol and ibm has by associ driven up the valu of tnpc but i think a deeper answer lie within sever factor first tnpc has been bankrol by some hefti invest in two separ privat placement investor such as enron ge capit equiti invest and dljmb partner among other put up about  million in startup capit in exchang for share in the compani enron is the major owner of tnpc with percent control this money has allow tnpc to make import acquisit for instanc tnpc bought the residenti and small commercia l retail energi busi of columbia energi group which includ approxim ly  naturalga custom and  electr custom in eight state this is a valuabl card in tnpcs deck as it lock in custom dure this time when deregul is develop slowli in retail market i wouldnt be surpris if tnpc make a similar acquisit of anoth custom base in the near futur such as in texa where custom have been spun off to energi servic compani rather than be held by the td oper of util in other word in texa tnpc could easili buy custom without have to buy wire or infrastructur assum there is a will seller second and perhap more import earlier this year enron transfer it residenti and small commerci retail oper in california and ohio to tnpc this deal includ the oper of enron energi servic but did not includ pge energi servic which enron acquir earlier this year togeth with the columbia energi group acquisit tnpc has come out of the gate run with a signific begin custom base of over  custom whi would enron have turn over it residenti custom to tnpc dont forget that enron struggl in and retreat from the california residenti market state that it couldnt make ani money in the retail market tnpcs sa file confirm rumor that enron energi servic actual retreat from california due to a lawsuit claimin g the compani had violat law relat to advertis direct to residenti al consum in  and  enron was in fact ban from sell power to the residenti market in california under this custom transfer enron is abl to put it money into a complet separ businessessen tialli move this highrisk busi ventur and worst perform part of it retail servic off it own book yet if tnpc succeed enron still benefi ts as it is the major owner i think these two factor answer whi wall street has look so favor on a selfdescrib new compani with a limit oper histori look ahead can tnpc maintain this compar high valu of it stock well there both good news and bad news for tnpc first let look on the bright side tnpc has put into place a great manag team start with h eugen lockhart former of att as presid and ceo other key player bring retail market expertis from work at mastercard exxon and pespico in addit within the energi industri tnpc arguabl could not have a better backer than enron what other compani touch has been golden in near everi ventur it has pursu in addit to be the major owner enron probabl is also provid tnpc access to commod at preferenti price which will certain enhanc it sale approach in the retail market plus tnpc has access to the  million custom that aol repres which ive alway thought was the compani secret weapon but then there are the risk and they are substanti first competit is not materi rapid on the retail side in a state like pennsylvan ia which perhap repres the strongest deregul market in the unit state onli about  percent of custom in peco territori have opt to switch their provid so tnpc has an uphil climb to say the least in make ani inroad at captur a lockand make moneyin the ret ail market second the onli way that i can see tnpc make it at all is if they continu to buy custom like they did from columbia energi group there are big question surround whether the compani will be abl to do this or not and much of it success hing on this uncertainti third and perhap most serious of all is tnpcs vulner on the technolog side of it oper tnpc has enter into a year revenu manag and custom care agreement with ibm global servic under which ibm will manag the compani onlin commerc and bill applic s ibm track record in develop custom care system is less than stellar in fact pge initi a lawsuit against ibm a few year ago when the util had to pull the plug on a massiv  million custom inform system cis employ by ibm which it claim was ineffect ibm has partner with sct to provid the infrastructur to be use by tnpc under an agreement between ibm global servic and sct the sct banner cis will be integr into a number of backoffic it solut under develop by ibm for tnpc expert in the cis industri have question whether scts banner cis can handl over one million custom if it cannot this will sure limit tnpcs growth potenti moreov although tnpcs ipo signal a strong futur there are many uncertainti surround this nascent oper as one of the few major player in the energi retail market tnpc has veri few competitor with the possibl except of newenergi or greenmountain anoth competitor is also emergi ng in britain centrica which plan to expand in north america after it recent acquisit of

opposit is true there is such a sens of esprit d corp that permeat your organ it make difficult thing easi and the imposs just anoth day in the offic there are no ego to trip over at enron when there is a problem to solv it is everyon problem peopl are not afraid of ask question they keep question until they understand nobodi mind repeat themselv they are incred patient with outsid lawyersspend hour and hour bring us up to speed as you well know your is not a simpl busi it is so refresh there are so mani benefit to this team approach  you get thing right the first time as you know in ani litig is critic that the court view your side as the teller of truth becaus you get thing right the first time the compani is not expos to be discredit when the other side respond  i would bet that enron outsid legal bill are half what they would be otherwis with most compani the outsid and insid lawyer get a minimum of support from the busi peopl the busi peopl view busi as busi and lawsuit as an annoy i should say that i could never understand that given the direct perhap it is the trader mental at the compani perhap it is an unwav focus on the bottom line perhap it is just that everyon feel they are a part of a team and they realiz that by work togeth the team can achiev thing that no one person can do work alon whatev the reason the outsid lawyer job is made so much easier that result in much much lower legal bill  you increas your chanc of win the brainstorm is so valuabl  the outsid lawyer like me feel they are part of the team outsid lawyer do not feel as if they are on trial they can ask the dumb question i know that all of us here are look forward to the next opportun to work with the enron team  human natur be what it isi think that when there are choic to be made

want to includ other permit other than cec as condit preced and they want us to rep that the schedul permit are the onli one requir to construct and oper this is far too oner and we are push back on this our plan is to get a psa that onli has hsr and cec permit as condit preced the other negoti item is with respect to mechan of continu the develop between sign and close and who pay for it and who
